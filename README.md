# logistic_regression_from_scratch
Here I try to make a logistic regression binary classifier on the cat vs dog dataset. The code is heavily inspired by deepmind.ai course but there have been improvements and I have tried to add more explanation from my side in a simpler language. Here we use a real dataset containing image files and so a lot of preprocessing goes into actually making it useful. 

Recommendation: 1. Try implementing resizing from scratch w/o the use of cv2 <br/>
              &emsp2. The model still overfits a lot so finetuning can be done

PS: The matrix file is just me trying to implement some functions on my own but most things like dot and transpose have been implemented with numpy due to performance superiority
